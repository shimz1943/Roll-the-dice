This app is just for practice


In the beginning the app asks if you called the milkman enough times to make him to answer the phone (possible answers y/yes or n/no, non case sensitive. If neither, then it shows a message and takes you back at the beginning).

If you weren't persitant enough (answered n/no 5 times) the app ends with a message ("Anxiety got all over you. No milk, no party. :(" )
However if you were persistent enough and answered y/yes then it takes you to second part of the app.

The milkman answers your call and asks you to provide the quantity of milk you want in liters.
The milkman is a good guy and offers a wholesale price for his dairy products and he's willing to offer you a discount depending on how much milk do you want.

After you're done entering the quantity, the app prints out a formatted message containing your ordered quantity of milk and the final price.
